# Meso_diet
Analysis of CCTD (California Current Trophic Database) to determine role of mesopelagic fishes as prey to higher trophic level predators.

Background: This code was written by Ily Iglesias (iiglesia@ucsc.edu). This R project provides code for the article "Mesopelagic fishes are important prey for a diversity of predators" submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science April, 2023.

Goals: This project provides code to
- access the CCTD from ERDDAP servers
- calculate the frequency of occurance of mesopealgic fishes in predator diet samples
- calculate comparative frequency of occurance for mesopealgic vs coastal pelagic forage fish spp.
- compare lengths between mesopelagic and coastal pelagic forage fish species
- plot maps with the location of collection trips that caught mesopelagic fishes
