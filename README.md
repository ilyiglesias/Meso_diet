# Meso_diet
Analysis of CCTD (California Current Trophic Database) to determine role of mesopelagic fishes as prey to higher trophic level predators.

Background: This code was written by Ily Iglesias (iiglesia@ucsc.edu). This R project provides code for the article "Mesopelagic fishes are important prey for a diversity of predators" submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science April, 2023. It includes all code used to access data, create figures for the frequency of occurance analysis and length frequency comparisons. (it omits the mapping portion of our study due to sensitivity concerns about some specific species location data)

Goals: This project provides code to
- access the CCTD from ERDDAP servers
- calculate the frequency of occurance of mesopealgic fishes in predator diet samples
- calculate comparative frequency of occurance for mesopealgic vs coastal pelagic forage fish spp.
- compare lengths between mesopelagic and coastal pelagic forage fish species
